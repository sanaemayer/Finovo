## Login

You can find the logout button at the bottom of the side navigation bar on the left side of the page. This side navigation bar can be accessed from most pages, and is at most a page away.

## Dashboard
![Dashboard](../images/User/Dashboard.png)
Your dashboard is a little hub that shows you a few recommendations (if they exist), as well as any featured articles. On your first time logging in, you’ll notice a notification that asks you to complete the Questionnaire if you’d like more recommendations based on your financial situation.

## The Questionnaire
![Questionnaire](../images/User/Questionnaire.png)
The questionnaire is something you can optionally fill out to provide us a better understanding of your financial situation so that we can give you recommendations on what to do, tailored to your situation. This data is kept confidential, and only site administrators can view it. This data will also help our financial coaches have a better understanding of your situation before your appointment, so that the hour you book isn’t wasted on explanation, and spent more on what to do.

## View/Edit Profile
![Profile](../images/User/Profile.png)
Pressing on the ‘Profile’ button on the side navigation bar will bring you to your profile page. On this page you will see some information about yourself, some buttons, and all of your recommendations, completed or not.

You can set a Preferred Name for yourself. This is purely a ‘cosmetic’ value that will only be shown to you (and our admins) on your dashboard. It is completely optional.

You can also access the questionnaire from this page to update your information at any time.

All of your recommendations will appear in 2 lists on this page. You can check recommendations to be completed, as well as unchecking completed recommendations to be incomplete if you had accidentally checked it.

  Set an article as Featured/Unfeature an article

Setting an article as featured ensures that all users will see it; the article will be posted on every user’s dashboard, and is pinned to the top of the articles list page.
	
Editing an article’s contents will direct you to a page similar to the create article page. 

Deleting an article is an irreversible process. Once that button is pressed it will be gone forever. Users will not be able to view it.
