# FinovoWell

This product aims to help employees manage their financial wellness by providing them with the steps they need to take, and resources they can look at to learn more about certain topics, such as investment. The main purpose of this site is providing recommendations to users who fill out our Questionnaire. The questionnaire provides us with a better understanding of their financial situation, and we can cater the recommendations to them. The Users of this product would be employees of the companies that license this product. The email addresses that the users would be registering with must be registered prior to their sign-up. Once they sign up, they have access to the site, however recommendations are limited until they complete the questionnaire. It is not mandatory to complete the quesitonnaire, they have full access to the other aspects of the site like financial tools and articles.
